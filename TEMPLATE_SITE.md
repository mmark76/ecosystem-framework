# Canonical Dashboard Template Site

This repository contains the dependency-free canonical shell for future
Markellos ecosystem dashboards.

## Source Files

- `index.html` — semantic shell, dialogs, reference content, and build metadata.
- `dashboard.css` — responsive layout, appearance modes, dialog styling, and
  accessible interaction states.
- `dashboard.js` — language shell, local appearance preferences, modal behavior,
  mobile navigation, copyright year, and build-ID formatting.
- `design-system/tokens/tokens.css` — approved ecosystem token adapter.
- `tests/dashboard-shell.test.cjs` — dependency-free contract and unit tests.
- `PROJECT_DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md` — canonical adoption standard.

## Canonical Contracts

Header:

```text
LEFT:  [Project identity]
RIGHT: [Project Assistant] | GR | EN | Back to markellosecosystem | Light/Dark | Settings | Info
```

Footer:

```text
© [year] Markellos Markides. All rights reserved.
vX.Y.Z_YYYYMMDD_HHMM_SHA
```

Settings provides Accent colour, Background colour, Font, Text size, Spacing,
Reset appearance, and Close. The single local-storage record contains validated
appearance preferences only.

Info contains Important Info, Feedback, License, Privacy, Analytics choices,
Copyright protected, the copyright line, and the build ID. Reference actions
explain where project-specific behavior belongs instead of linking to invented
destinations.

The dashboard UI must not visibly expose GitHub. Engineering documentation may
continue to reference repositories internally.

## Localization

The reference provides GR/EN architecture and translates canonical shell
controls. Sample project content remains English, and the UI says so. Adopting
projects must externalize and provide all project strings before claiming full
Greek/English localization.

## Appearance Persistence

The key `markellos.dashboard.appearance.v1` stores only:

```text
colorMode, accent, background, font, textSize, spacing
```

Values are allow-listed or validated before use. Storage is optional: when it
is blocked or unavailable, the controls remain functional for the current page.

## Build Metadata Injection

The reference metadata is intentionally incomplete:

```html
<meta name="build-version" content="2.0.0">
<meta name="build-date" content="">
<meta name="build-time" content="">
<meta name="build-time-zone" content="Europe/Nicosia">
<meta name="build-commit" content="">
```

This displays the non-fabricated fallback:

```text
v2.0.0_YYYYMMDD_HHMM_SHA
```

An approved build/release process must inject:

- the real semantic project version;
- `YYYYMMDD` and `HHMM` produced with an IANA-timezone API configured to
  `Europe/Nicosia`;
- the real Git commit, from which the formatter uses seven lowercase hex
  characters.

Do not use a fixed UTC offset and do not type a guessed SHA. A populated build
ID must match:

```regex
^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+_[0-9]{8}_[0-9]{4}_[0-9a-f]{7}$
```

`dashboard.js` exports dependency-free formatting helpers for approved build
tooling and tests. Its timezone test covers both EET and EEST behavior.

## Verification

Run:

```powershell
node --check dashboard.js
node --test tests/dashboard-shell.test.cjs
```

Also verify the page in a real browser at narrow, medium, and wide sizes,
including Assistant, GR/EN, ecosystem return, Light/Dark, Settings persistence
and reset, Info, mobile navigation, modal focus/Escape behavior, 200% zoom,
console errors, horizontal overflow, and visual hierarchy.

## Adoption Boundary

This is a future-adoption standard. Do not propagate it to an existing
repository or deployment without a separate approved task. Copying template
files does not authorize a production deployment, DNS change, or release.
